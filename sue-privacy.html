        <h2>Sue Bot - Trilobite Tavern Discord Server</h2>

        <p>Welcome to the Trilobite Tavern Discord server! This Privacy Policy outlines how the custom Discord bot "Sue," developed for our server, collects, uses, and handles your data. By using Sue, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Sue bot monitors and records various types of information available through the Discord API, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Messages in channels that the bot has access to</li>
            <li>User activities such as joining, moving, and leaving voice channels</li>
            <li>Changes in user profiles, such as avatar, name, and username updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Data Usage</h3>
        <p>The collected information is logged into Discord staff channels and not stored in Sue's private database. This means that all collected information remains on Discord servers. The only data stored in Sue's private database is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User's Discord ID for the economy system (balance, level, and XP tracking)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, users' avatars are stored on the machine hosting the bot for caching purposes, but not in the database.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Retention</h3>
        <p>All information collected by Sue is only retained within the confines of Discord's servers and the hosting machine for caching avatars. No personal data, other than the economy system data (Discord ID, balance, level, and XP) and cached avatars, is stored privately by the Sue bot.</p>

        <h3>4. Responsibility and Liability</h3>
        <p>The bot developer, Tyzeron, and the Trilobite Tavern Discord server are not responsible for any issues that may arise from the use of Sue, including but not limited to data breaches, unauthorized access, or misuse of information. Tyzeron and the Trilobite Team is immune from any responsibilities regarding privacy.</p>

        <h3>5. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
